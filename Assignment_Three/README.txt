Running Instructions

Enter the following bash commands:

* make
* ./smallsh

After these commands you will enter into the smallsh program and can run the supported shell commands that have been implemented.
Enter 'exit' to terminate the smallsh main process.

You can run 'make clean' to remove the existing executable to then recompile for a new one when developing.
